# Unit-Converter
The code uses file to execute
Hence to run the code make sure the files named "path_assign.txt" & "path_follow.txt" are also downloaded and is in the same folder as the "converter.cpp" is in.
"path_assign.txt" contains the initial units the user wants to convert from. eg(User wants to convert kilometer to centimeter then path_assign.txt contains {km cm}).
"path_follow.txt" contains the path to complete the transformation of units.eg(User wants to convert kilometer to centimeter then path_follow.txt contains path as {km m c} which states that kilometer must be first converted to meters then to centimeters.)
