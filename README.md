# Unit-Converter
The code uses file to execute
Hence to run the code make sure the files named "path_assign.txt" & "path_follow.txt" are also downloaded and is in the same folder as the "converter.cpp" is in.
To add new unit follow the steps:
1.In "library.txt" write the conversion unit eg(1 ant = 1.5 cm)
2. Then in "path_assign.txt" add the source unit and target unit. eg(if you want to convert km to ant just write (km ant))
3. Now in previous eg to convert km to ant write its path in "path_follow.txt" like eg(km m cm ant STOP), this tells that the km gets converted to m then to cm and then to ant unit and the STOPS tell that unit is converted.
